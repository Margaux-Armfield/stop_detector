# Stop Detector and Visualizer for Movement Data

MoveApps

Github repository: *https://github.com/Margaux-Armfield/stop_detector.git* 

## Description

Identify and display stops in trajectory data from geotags. Set the time (in hours) and distance (meters) that is 
considered a stop. Stops are displayed on a map, with the option to display any subsequent movement after the stop.

## Documentation

### Intended Use

This app is intended to aid in analysis of movement data from animal geotags.

Stop detection can be useful for a number of conservation interests, as a "long stop" can indicate than an animals has:

(1) died / been poached  
(2) lost its tag  
(3) is remaining stationary for some other reason related to its biology / life history (hibernation, injury, birth, etc.)  

In order to detect stops, this application makes use of the MovingPandas Python library and allows the user to 
define a "stop of interest" via the configuration settings (see **Settings**).

Furthermore, the stops detected are displayed on a map, along with any subsequent movement after the stop began 
if desired (see **Settings**). Viewing the trajectory after the stop began may be useful in determining which of the 
scenarios (death, tag loss, injury, etc) the stop actually represents. For example, if a user is trying to detect 
deaths or tag loss, a subsequent movement of 200,000 meters could indicate that the animal has not died, but stopped 
for some other reason. Thus, the user could consider re-running the application with more conservative settings 
(i.e. increasing stop duration time and / or decreasing stop diameter size).

### Example Stop Detection in Caribou Dataset

source: Movebank study - 216040785 / Mountain caribou in British Columbia

Say a user wants to detect possible deaths among caribou present in this study. The first time running this application, 
the user sets the app configuration to the following:

![Caribou Example Settings](documentation/example_setting.png)

and sees the following map at output:

**Caribou Data with Stop Duration=120 hours, Stop Diameter=100 meters**

![Caribou Example GIF](documentation/120_hours2.gif)

This map shows the location of stop points, along with the trajectory of the animal following the stop. We can hover 
over the trajectory to see the trajectory ID and distinguish it from overlapping trajectories through a color change.
Clicking the trajectory shows the bounding box encompassing that trajectory. We can tell which trajectory is associated
with a given stop point based on matching the tractory's ID to the point's Stop ID.

We can see from the red trajectories that many of these animals go on to travel great distances after the stop 
took place, making a death or tag loss unlikely.

Perhaps 120 hours spent within 100 meters is not a conservative enough test for whether a caribou has died. We 
increase the stop_duration to 150 hours, and get the following result, which shows shorter trajectories after stops
(indicating less post-stop movement) and fewer stop points:

**Caribou Data with Stop Duration=150 hours, Stop Diameter=100 meters**

In addition to looking at the distance traveled since the detected stop, users may want to look at other metrics 
included in the output CSV files to determine if a stop represents a death or tag loss. For example, we could compare 
the mean rate across all trajectories with the mean rate after the stop was detected to inspect if the animal has 
slowed down significantly during and after the stop.

### Application Execution

The app iterates through all provided Trajectories and searches for stop points. For each stop detected, a 
point is added to the output map. Data for each stop is also stored as a dataframe, which is output as a CSV file.

### Input data

MovingPandas TrajectoryCollection in Movebank format

### Output data

MovingPandas TrajectoryCollection in Movebank format: either the original data or the trajectories of detected stops
(from stop `start_time` to `final_observation_time`), depending on user configuration (see **Settings**).

### Artefacts

- `map.html` - an HTML file containing the Folium map, displaying stop points, with option to hover over points to show more data and zoom in / out. The map optionally displays the animal's trajectories after the stops began as well.
- `final_stops.csv` - a csv file containing the final stop points for individuals (i.e. most recent stop if there are more than one for a given individual), detected matching the configuration parameters, with the following columns: 
  - `stop_id`: string - the unique identifier for the stop (trajectory_id + start_time of stop)
  - `geometry`: point - the latitude and longitude position of the stop
  - `start_time`: timestamp - the time the stop began
  - `end_time`: timestamp - the time the stop ended
  - `traj_id`: string - the unique identifier of the trajectory that this stop was detected in 
  - `duration_s`: time duration - the time duration in seconds of the stop
  - `final_observation_time`: timestamp - the time when the final point in the trajectory was recorded (which will be greater than or equal to the `stop_end_time`)
  - `time_tracked_since_stop_began`: time duration - the time between when the stop started (`start_time`) and when the final observation was recorded (`final_observation_time`)
  - `mean_rate_all_tracks`: speed (meters per second) - the average rate in meters per second that the animal was moving across all observations
  - `distance_traveled_since_stop_began`: distance (meters) - the number of meters that the animal has travel since the stop began
  - `average_rate_since_stop_began`: speed (meters per second) - - the average rate in meters per second that the animal was moving after the stop began

If the setting `Final stop only` is `False`, an additional csv file will be output:
  - `all_stops.csv` - a csv file containing all the stop points detected matching the configuration parameters, with the same contents as above. 

### Settings 

The following settings are required:

- `Minimum duration in hours` (hours): The minimum duration in hours that is considered a stop of interest (death or tag loss probable). Unit: `hours`.
- `Maximum stop diameter` (meters): Defined diameter that the animal has to stay in for the configured time for it to 
be considered stop. Unit: `meters`.
- `Final stop only` (boolean): If only the last stop in a trajectory (that is, the most recent stop) should be considered (displayed on the output map and output to `all_stops.csv` file), in the case that more than one stop exist for a given individual. `True` or `False`.
- `Display trajectories after stops` (boolean): If the trajectory movement of the animal (starting from when the stop began) should be displayed on the output map. `True` or `False`. If set to `False`, only the location of the stop will be shown.
- `Return data` (string): the type of data that should be returned from this app (to be used in subsequent applications in a Workflow). Either `Trajectories after stops` or `Input trajectory data`.
  - `Trajectories after stops`: (MovingPandas TrajectoryCollection) - Return the trajectories of the detected stops, starting at stop's `start_time` and ending at the final observation in the trajectory.
  - `Input trajectory data`: (MovingPandas TrajectoryCollection) - Return the input data provided, unchanged.

### Null or error handling

**Setting `Minimum duration in hours`:** If no Minium duration is given (NULL), then a default duration of 120 hours (5 days) is set. 

**Setting `Maximum stop diameter`:** If no Maximum stop diameter is given, then a default diameter of 100 meters is set.

**Setting `Final stop only`:** If no selection for Display final stop only is given, then a default value of `True` is set.

**Setting `Display trajectories after stops`:** If no selection for Display trajectories after stops is given, then a default value of `True` is set.

**Setting `Return data`:** If no selection for Return data is given, then a default value of `Trajectories after stops` is set.
